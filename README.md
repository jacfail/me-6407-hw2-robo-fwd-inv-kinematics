# me-6407-hw2-robo-fwd-inv-kinematics

## Overview
This code is all done in MATLAB. It covers topics like transformation matrices and inverse and forward kinematics

There is only one script in this repository. A requirement is that you use MATLAB.


## Problem 1
### Description

Code: `HW2_JacobFaile.m`

In problem 1, part A the given a selection of theta values for a three revolute joint robot manipulator, the end point positions were calculated. This was done with forward kinematics.

In problem 1, part B the endpoint position was given for a three revolute joint robot manipulator. With this the possible theta values for the joints were calculated. This was done with inverse kinematics.


## Problem 2

### Description

Code: `HW2_JacobFaile.m`

Same script was used for this problem. Inverse kinematics was done to have a manipulator follow a circular trajectory with a radius of 0.2 meters and all the postures were plotted.
